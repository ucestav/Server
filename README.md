The server files for quiz app and question app 

# Technical Guide

1. NodeJS Server

There are two NodeJS Server files - one for the quiz app and another for the question app. 

Tbe httpServer.js file is used to read questions (quiz points) from the database. Connection details for postGIS are provided in a postGISConnection.js file. Data from the postGIS database are read into a GeoJSON FeatureCollection format which is then inserted into the map as markers. Express.js allows routing by using app.get() to retrieve quiz points and app.post() to upload data in database.

2. Quiz App

The objective of the Quiz App is to generate a question for the user once they are in close-proximity to a point of interest (POI). The location of the user is tracked and a multiple-choice question pops up when they are within a specific distance from a given point. The question relates to the POI. For example, a question about the number of students at UCL could be created if a user was near UCL. The user selects an answer and the system notifies them if they are right or wrong. The answers and phone ID are uploaded to a database when the user submits their final answer. A new question pops up when the user moves to a new location.

There are 4 files that are used to achieve functionality in the Quiz App. The ‘index.html’ file has code relating to the app design, the ‘upload.Data.js’ relates to uploading data into the database, ‘appActivity.js’ relates to quiz functions, and ‘httpServer.js’ allows data transfer between database and app. The user guide is labelled 'Quiz_Guide.html' in www directory.

Quiz data from the PostgreSQL database is requested and inserted into the Quiz App. A marker is inserted on a map to identify the location of the quiz points. The code incorporates the haversine formula to calculate the distance between a user and a POI. The user has to be less than 5 metres from the POI to create a quiz popup on the map. For example, when a user is less than 5 metres from the front gates of UCL, a popup is created to ask the user what movie had scenes filmed in UCL. There are four alternative answers ‘Inception’, ‘Spiderman’, ‘Thor’ and ‘Transformers’ that are inserted as checkboxes. The user can select on of these answers and an alert message indicates whether they are right or wrong. The database contains the correct answer which is matched against the value of each checkbox. If they match, an alert message is created to notify the user that they are correct. If they don’t match, an alert message is created to notify the user that they are incorrect. The selected answer(s) and phone ID value is inserted into the database once the user presses the submit button.

Steps to Run Question App
1. Download Quiz App: The code to run this app is on a GitHub account(https://github.com/ucestav). PhoneGap Build can be used to create the app and a QR reader is able to download it onto a mobile device
2. Run NodeJS Server File: Existing questions are inserted onto the map and phone ID and answers are uploaded into database 
3. Open Quiz App and locate user's position: The user's location is identified by a red marker and the map view is set to have the    user's location at the centre. 
4. The position of the user is tracked as they move. Once the user is within 5 metres from a location that has a question attached to it, a popup will appear with the question and four checkbox answers
5. The user selects the answer and an alert will appear to notify them if it is correct or wrong. 
6. The user inserts a phone ID
7. After the user has selected an answer and inserted a phone ID, press the submit button to upload data into database 
8. Move to a new location for another question </li>

3. Question App

The objective of the Question App is to create a new question when a point on the map is clicked. The user inputs a question and four alternative answers which relate to the POI. The data is then stored in a database and can be inserted into the Quiz App when it is launched.

Similar to the Quiz App, there are 4 files that are used to achieve functionality in the Question App.  The ‘index.html’ file has code relating to the app design, the ‘upload.Data.js’ relates to uploading data into the database, ‘appActivity.js’ relates to quiz functions, and ‘httpServer.js’ allows data transfer between database and app. The user guide is labelled 'Question_Guide.html' in www directory. 

Quiz data from the PostgreSQL database is requested and inserted into the Question App. A marker is inserted on a map to identify the location of the quiz points and a corresponding popup states that it is a ‘Location with Existing Question’. The user is able to select any point on a map and a popup with text fields relating to the question, four alternative answers, correct answer, longitude and latitude is created. The user inserts the relevant information for each text field and these values are inserted into the PostgreSQL databse when the submit button is pressed. The location of a user is tracked and the map view is set to its boundaries. This function helps the user to identify their own position and they can become orientated with their own surroudings first. 

Steps to Run Question App
1. Download Question App: The code to run this app is on a GitHub account (https://github.com/ucestav).
2. Run NodeJS Server: Existing questions are inserted on the map and new questions are uploaded into the database 
3. Open Question App and locate user's position: The user's location is identified by a red marker and the map view is set to have the user's location at the centre. 
4. Search map and click on a location: Existing questions are identified by blue markers. A user creates a question that is relevant to the location.
5. A popup with textboxes will appear at the clicked location and the user is required to input the following data: a question, four alternative answers, the correct answer, longitude and latitude.
6. After all textboxes are filled out, press the submit button and the data is inserted into the database.
