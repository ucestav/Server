The server files for quiz app and question app 

# Technical Guide

1. NodeJS Server

There are two NodeJS Server files - one for the quiz app and another for the question app. 

Tbe httpServer.js file is used to read questions (quiz points) from the database. Connection details for postGIS are provided in a postGISConnection.js file. Data from the postGIS database are read into a GeoJSON FeatureCollection format which is then inserted into the map as markers. Express.js allows routing by using app.get() to retrieve quiz points and app.post() to upload data in database.

2. Quiz App

The quiz app tracks the location of a user and asks a question when the user is in close-proximity (less than 5 metres). The haversine formula is used to calculate the distance between a user and the location of a question. The file 'appActivity.js' contains t and 'uploadData.js' contains functions for
